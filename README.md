# Soup - Grepping tool
I got tired of using stable command line tools like `grep`, so i made an unstable one!
It works... I think? I haven't tested it yet. But hey! It's written in go!

Install
-------
Firstly, you wanna clone the repo:
```bash
# Git
git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/soup
# Gh
gh repo clone ElisStaaf/soup
```
Then, you want to build the executable:
```bash
make
# OR
go build soup.go
```
Then you're done!

Usage
-----
```bash
soup <query> <path>
```
